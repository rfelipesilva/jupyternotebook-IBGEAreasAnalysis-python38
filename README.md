# IBGE areas analysis
This jupyter notebook was made to analyze the data from IBGE related to the **Brazil** municipalities from 2020.

### Welcome! Here is basically what you need to start exploring that analysis:

1. Installing requirements -> check the **``requirements folder``** to install all dependencies;

2. Get the data -> download or clone this repository and the data will be available within **``data folder``**, if you're facing any issue there is a explanation where the data is coming from and how to get it from the official **IBGE page**;

3. Explore the jupyter notebook inside **``src folder``** -> IBGE_Areas_Analysis;

4. Here is some of the information and subject available in the analysis:
    * Handling with NULL values
    * Handling with duplicate records
    * Merging information
    * Simple view of the shapefile with color differentiation
    * Dissolving geospatial data
    * Simple bar chart with count of occurrences
    * Simple heat map visualization according to values

5. Would you like to contribute? here are some ideas:
    - [ ] **Folium** -> to put a nice background map in the visualization
    - [ ] **Interactive map** -> Maybe streamlit, just thinking loud
