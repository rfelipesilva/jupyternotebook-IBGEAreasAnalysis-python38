# IBGE areas analysis
This jupyter notebook was made to analyze the data from IBGE related to the **Brazil** municipalities from 2020.

### Welcome! Here is some of the information and subject available in the analysis:
> - Handling with NULL values;
> - Handling with duplicate records;
> - Merging information;
> - Simple view of the shapefile with color differentiation;
> - Dissolving geospatial data;
> - Simple bar chart with count of occurrences;
> - Simple heat map visualization according to values;

### To start playing, there are two ways to check the analysis:

1. Don't want to install anything in your machine? Here is the easiest way: using a virtual environment with [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org):
    - Click in the launch binder to start the jupyter notebook -> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rfelipesilva/jupyternotebook-IBGEAreasAnalysis-python38/HEAD?filepath=src%2FIBGE_Areas_Analysis.ipynb)

2. If you want to proceed with the traditional way, here is the steps to get everything installed:
    -  Installing requirements -> check the **``requirements folder``** to install all dependencies;
    - Get the data -> download or clone this repository and the data will be available within **``data folder``**, if you're facing any issue there is a explanation where the data is coming from and how to get it from the official **IBGE page**;
    - Explore the jupyter notebook inside **``src folder``** -> IBGE_Areas_Analysis;

### Would you like to contribute? here are some ideas:
 - [ ] **Folium** -> to put a nice background map in the visualization
 - [ ] **Interactive map** -> Maybe streamlit (just thinking loud)
